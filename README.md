üöÄ Mastering the Linux Environment
The command line is the primary diagnostic and investigative tool for a software tester. It offers direct, unfiltered access to the application environment.

üó∫Ô∏è Navigating the Filesystem: Key directories include /var/log, /tmp, /etc, and /home/user.

üîë The Language of Permissions: A frequent source of bugs! Use ls -l to view permissions and chmod to change them.

üí° The Interview Gauntlet: Real-World Scenarios
Here's how to approach common interview problems:

Scenario: Application is running, but you can't access it from the browser.
# 1. Is the process listening on the correct port?
ss -tuln | grep <port_number>

# 2. Is a firewall blocking the port?
sudo iptables -L

# 3. Are there network-related errors in the logs?
tail -n 100 /var/log/app.log

Scenario: The application has crashed.
# 1. Any out-of-memory errors in system logs?
grep -i "out of memory" /var/log/messages

# 2. Can you find a core dump file?
find / -name "core*"

# 3. Is the disk full?
df -h

ü§ñ Leveling Up with Shell Scripting
The example scripts for automating common QA tasks are in the /scripts directory.

health_check.sh: Automates a system health check.

scan_log.sh: Scans a log file for predefined error patterns.

backup_test_data.sh: Creates a timestamped backup of a directory.

üèÉ How to Run the Scripts
Make the scripts executable (only need to do this once):

chmod +x scripts/*.sh

Execute a script:

# Example: Scan the system log for errors
./scripts/scan_log.sh /var/log/syslog
